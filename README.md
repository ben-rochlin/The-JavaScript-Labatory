# The-JavaScript-Labatory
### The place for me to tinker and learn with all things JS
----

Some days it might be a codewars challenge, other days it might be something random that pops into my head, or it could be a problem im trying to solve in a project which ends up here.

This area does not exist to solve programming challenges in the simplest, quickest or even cleverest of ways. Its purpose is to actually expand my knowledge and experience, to go down rabbit holes or to fly off on tangents.

The idea here is to actually take the simplest challenges and see how complex I can make them, how many roads can be walked down to find a solution, and ultimately become more comfortable navigating these roads.
